       <strong>What is Lorem Ipsum?</strong> 
        Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
         Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy <br>
         text ever since the 1500s,when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type<br>
        specimen book.It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into<br> 
         electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset<br> 
        sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker <br>
         including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
